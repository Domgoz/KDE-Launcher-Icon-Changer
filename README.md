# KDE-Launcher-Icon-Changer
A basic bash script that changes the icon of the KDE Kickoff application launcher with a selected folder of icons. Icon change effected every restart.

How to use:
  1. Put your folder of icons path in the specified field in the code.
  2. Make the script execute at startup.
  3. Run the script for immediate change or restart plasma.

## My issues with the code:
i originally wanted the code to change the icon once every 10 minutes or similer. But i never found out how to make the process seamless, as everytime the icon changes, a plasmashell restart is required to see the effect. Sooo, if anyone know how to do it without restarting plasmashell, please tell me!
